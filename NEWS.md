# set6 0.1.1

- `absComplement` method is now deprecated, instead use `setcomplement` and omit the `y` argument

# set6 0.1.0

- `set6` upgrades the `sets` package to R6. Many forms of mathematical sets are implemented, including (countably finite) sets, tuples, intervals (countably infinite or uncountable), and fuzzy variants. Wrappers extend functionality by allowing symbolic representations of complex operations on sets, including unions, (cartesian) products, exponentiation, and differences (asymmetric and symmetric).
- See [the website](https://raphaels1.github.io/set6/) for more details and the project readme
- See [getting started vignette](https://raphaels1.github.io/set6/articles/set6.html) for a short tutorial and introduction
- `set6` is currently 'maturing', so whilst no major updates are planned they may happen. Constant minor updates should be expected.
